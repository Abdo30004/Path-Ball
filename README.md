# PinBall Recall Game

## Description

This is a game project for University of Tecknology and Sciences Houari Boumediene (USTHB) in Algiers, Algeria. It's a 2D p puzzle game made with SDL2 and C.

## Game Description

In Pinball Recall, your objective is to remember the positions of various bumpers before they disappear. This task extends beyond simple memorization, requiring players to mentally simulate how the ball will rebound off these bumpers and predict its subsequent trajectory. This challenge not only tests your ability to retain information but also demands the analytical skill to interpret and anticipate the ball's movements, making it a cognitive exercise that involves both memory and strategic reasoning.
